title: "Instructor notes: Patents"
...


# Outcomes
The students should be able to

1. understand the difference between copyright and patent
2. be aware of why software and hardware patents are a matter of debate
3. articulate both pro-IP and anti-IP arguments in the computing space

# Scheduling
This lesson should follow a discussion of an instructor-created design that students have implemented.

# Flow
1.  Introduce copyright vs patent and discuss them in the context of the instructor's design:

    - "Can *instructor name* patent *design* you implemented? Or copyright it?"
    - Pause long enough for students to realize they don't know the difference
    - Explain the high-level points:
        
        Copyright
        :   Ownership of a creative expression.
            In USA, automatically bestowed when you create (though not automatically documented as your creation).
                        
            Your copyright is violated if I *copy* your work without permission, but not if I independently re-create on my own.
            
            Lasts for a long time (a lifetime or more).
            
            Fair-use and derivative works make details complicated.
        
        Patent
        :   Ownership of a creative process.
            In USA, only bestowed if formally filed for and awarded,
            and only if the filer was the first to invent the process.
            
            Your patent is violated if I *use* your process without permission, whether I learned it from you or not.
            But it is much easier to defend in court if I did learn it from you.
            
            Last for long enough to get market advantage (10â€“20 years).
            
            Originality, prior art, and ambiguous filings make most patents unenforceable.
            
    - "Can *instructor name* patent *design* you implemented? Or copyright it?"
        - can copyright the *description* of it
        - might be able to patent the design itself

2. Discuss pro- and anti- views of patents in computing
    
    - "Should *instructor name* patent *design* you implemented?"
        - pro: should be able to protect invested time
        - con: not very interesting, complicated, or original
    - "If *instructor name* patented *design* and sued you for implementing it, who would win the court case?"
        - implementer, probably
        - but courts don't understand computing, so outcome hazy
        - huge time, PR, and legal fee cost either way

3. Summarize current situation:
    
    - Companies stockpile computing patents
    - Most as a legal cold-war: sue me on this one and I'll sue you on these others
    - If a developer reads a patent, the developer's employer becomes much easier to sue for patent violation
