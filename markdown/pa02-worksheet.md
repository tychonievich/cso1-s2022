title: Gates worksheet
...


# Overview

This homework is to be handed in on paper at the beginning of class on its due date.
Because there is no easy way to receive paper over the weekend, the 80%-value late period will extend to the beginning of the following class session.


# Task

Fill out the worksheet handed out in class one week before the due date.
If you were not there, please print out [pa02.pdf](files/pa02.pdf) and fill it out.

Submit in one of the following two ways:

- Bring a filled-in paper to class on Friday and give it to the instructor.

- Upload an image of your answer to GradeScope, either on [collab](https://collab.its.virginia.edu/portal/site/5c4b9286-c13d-4a4e-a5d9-5af58952ffcc/page/5e4642d2-7b08-4e8a-ac4a-ccdf0210b29f) or by GradeScope entry code **RWJ4JG**. After you upload, please assign the pages of the upload to the corresponding questions and then click the "submit" button.


# Collaboration

As is commonly done^[It is not clear to us that this is commonly *allowed* per course policies, but it is commonly *done*.] on math-worksheet-like assignments, you may collaborate with other students in this class.
As an exception to the usual collaboration policy, you do not need to tell us about casual interactions of the "I got $X$, what did you get?" variety.
But do cite any close collaboration or major corrections; for example if the answer to the above hypothetical was "I think $X$ is wrong, here's why" and then you change your answer, add a note like "mst3k suggested this answer" next to your answer.

This exception does not apply to sources other than other students in this course. Websites, outside tutors, etc., are still subject to [the usual plagiarism rules](policies.html#honesty).

[As always](policies.html#understand-what-you-submit), we reserve the right to request you explain your solutions to us and may penalize you if it appears that you did not understand what you submitted as your work.
